# About the project
Hi! This project was created to show the measurements of a dog of different breeds.The measurements shown are 
1. Lifespan: 
2. Weight:
3. Height (Withers): 
4. Back Length: 
5. Neck Circumference: 
6. Chest Circumference (Girth): 

So as to allow user to be able to get collar leash, harness or clothes for their pet dog.



Built using :

React with API from https://thedogapi.com/ for the 1st 3 measurements and the last 3 measuremets is data consolidated into a JSON file

How it works:

Future Goals
- To be able to toggle between metrics and imperial measurements
- To further develop it for user to keep track of their own pet dog measureemnts as it grows ( kind of like a diary or tracker)
